# Fully Isolated Web Workers

This is inspired by the paper
https://devd.me/papers/LeastPrivileges.pdf[Privilege Separation in
HTML5 Applications] by Devdatta Akhawe, Prateek Saxena, and Dawn Song
but addresses a slightly different use case:

We want to run fully isolated web workers -- they should not have any
network or local storage access.

We reuse the technique from the paper of using a null-origin IFRAME as
sandbox (to prevent access to same-origin resources like IndexedDB).

Inside the IFRAME, we set a CSP of "default-src 'none'" to prevent
network access.  We allow a main SCRIPT tag in the IFRAME to run with
a script-src nonce.  We also allow data: URIs to run the web
workers.

(Compared to the paper, the only untrusted code runs in a web worker.
The main page and IFRAME are trusted, but could additionally be locked
down using the techniques described in the paper.)

## How to run the demo

* Go to *https://manuel.github.io/fully-isolated-web-workers/index.html* in Chrome or Firefox.

* Check the console for errors.  You should see the following error messages:

** `Failed to execute 'open' on 'IDBFactory'` -- 
   the worker has no access to IndexedDB.

** `Refused to load the script 'https://manuel.github.io/test.js'` -- 
   the worker can not load scripts from the domain on which the page is hosted.

** `Refused to load the script 'https://cors-test.appspot.com/test'` -- 
   the worker can not load scripts from CORS-enabled hosts.

** `Refused to connect to 'https://manuel.github.io/test'` --
   the worker can not make XHR requests to the domain on which the page is hosted.
   
** `Refused to connect to 'https://cors-test.appspot.com/test'` --
   the worker can not make XHR requests to CORS-enabled hosts.

## Note

An attacker could bring the browser to load the `iframe.html` outside of the 
sandbox established by `index.html`, making the workers run not in a null-origin,
but on the same origin as `index.html`.

To prevent this, the technique from https://devd.me/papers/LeastPrivileges.pdf#page=7[Listing 1]
of the paper should be used (constructing the IFRAME dynamically with a data: URI).
I will do this in a future version.
