# Fully Isolated Web Workers

This is inspired by the paper
https://devd.me/papers/LeastPrivileges.pdf[Privilege Separation in
HTML5 Applications] by Devdatta Akhawe, Prateek Saxena, and Dawn Song
but addresses a slightly different use case:

We want to run fully isolated web workers -- they should not have any
network or local storage access.

We reuse the technique from the paper of using a null-origin IFRAME as
sandbox (to prevent access to same-origin resources like IndexedDB).

Inside the IFRAME, we set a CSP of "default-src 'none'" to prevent
network access.  We allow a main SCRIPT tag in the IFRAME to run with
a script-src nonce.  We also allow script-src data URIs to run the web
workers.

So in this approach, the only untrusted code runs in a web worker.
The main page and IFRAME are trusted, but could additionally be locked
down using the techniques from the paper.

## How to run the demo

* Open the file index.html in Chrome or Firefox.

* Check the console for errors.  You should see three different error messages (with messages from Chrome):

** `Failed to execute 'open' on 'IDBFactory'` -- this demonstrates
   that the worker doesn't have access to local storage.

** `Refused to load the script
   'https://cors-test.appspot.com/test'` -- this demonstrates that
   the worker cannot load scripts, even from CORS-enabled servers

** `Refused to connect to 'https://cors-test.appspot.com/test'` --
   this demonstrates that the worker cannot make XHR requests to
   CORS-enabled servers.
